	"rest_framework",
	"docme",
	"mdeditor",
	...,
]


# File Uploading for Mdeditor 
MEDIA_URL = '/media/'
MEDIA_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'media/')

```

3. add this to `urls.py` :

```python
from django.urls import path, include
from django.conf.urls.static import static
from django.conf import settings

urlpatterns = [
	...,
	path(r'mdeditor/', include('mdeditor.urls')),
	path("docme/", include("docme.urls")), # Important don't change the docme/ urls otherwise it's not work .
	...,
]

urlpatterns += static(settings.MEDIA_URL, document_root=settings.MEDIA_ROOT)
```
