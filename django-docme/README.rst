# django-docme :

---
Django Doc me 

package that let you create your docs not coding it  ðŸ˜‰ðŸ˜‰ .

---
#### we can split this package into 2 part , the frontend and the backend :

- **Frontend** build with sveltekit and skeleton UI .
- **backend** with djangorestframework and python .


## Quick start
-----------
1. install the package from releases :
`pip install ./package_name.tar.gz`
2. add app to `setting.py` :
```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
	...,
	"rest_framework",
	"docme",
	"mdeditor",
	...,
]


# File Uploading for Mdeditor 
MEDIA_URL = '/media/'
MEDIA_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'media/')

```

3. add this to `urls.py` :

```python
from django.urls import path, include
from django.conf.urls.static import static
from django.conf import settings

urlpatterns = [
	...,
	path(r'mdeditor/', include('mdeditor.urls')),
	path("docme/", include("docme.urls")),
	...,
]

urlpatterns += static(settings.MEDIA_URL, document_root=settings.MEDIA_ROOT)
```

4. Now you just need to add the view you like :

```python
from docme.views import index

urlpatterns = [
	...,
	path("your_path/", index), # enter the path you want 
]
```

5. migrate the db by running `python manage.py migrate` .
6. run the developent server `python manage.py runserver`.
7. visite the link `http://127.0.0.1:8000/your_path` .
and here you go .
I finish this later .
